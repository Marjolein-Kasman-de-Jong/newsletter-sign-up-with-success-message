# Newsletter Sign Up With Success Message

[Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv)

The challenge was to build out the newsletter sign up form and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Users should be able to:

* Add their email and submit the form
* See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
* See form validation messages if:
    * The field is left empty
    * The email address is not formatted correctly
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
